This is my attempt at a HackerRank 30day JS challenge on Algorithms and Problem Solving.

Starting from 25th May, I took a problem from the Hackerank and tried to implement my own solutions.
10 Easy, 10 Medium and 10 Advanced JS problems. The link to the hackerrank problem for each day is added in this readme file and the js file for my solution is shown in the repo.
Thanks.
