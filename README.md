This is my attempt at a HackerRank 30day JS challenge on Algorithms and Problem Solving.

Starting from 25th May, I took a problem from the Hackerank and tried to implement my own solutions.
10 Easy, 10 Medium and 10 Advanced JS problems. The link to the hackerrank problem for each day is added in this readme file and the js file for my solution is shown in the repo.
Thanks.

# Easy Level Challenges
Day 1 (✅)=> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/simple-array-sum/problem 
Day 2 (✅)=> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/compare-the-triplets/problem
Day 3 (✅)=> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/diagonal-difference/problem
Day 4 (✅)=> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/staircase/problem
Day 5 (✅)=> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/plus-minus/problem
Day 6 (✅)=> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/counting-valleys/problem
This day 6 challemge was weird. I wrote a very complicated process that was solving the challenge but it wasn't nearly properly optimized. So I had to brainstorm with @cokejnr and we came up with an algorithm that would allow us loop over the string just once. Unlike when I was looping over the string multiple times. Beautiful tbh.

Day 7 (✅)=> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/mini-max-sum/problem
Day 8 (✅)=> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/birthday-cake-candles/problem
