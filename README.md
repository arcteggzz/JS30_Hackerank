This is my attempt at a HackerRank 30day JS challenge on Algorithms and Problem Solving.

Starting from 25th May, I took a problem from the Hackerank and tried to implement my own solutions.
10 Easy, 10 Medium and 10 Advanced JS problems. The link to the hackerrank problem for each day is added in this readme file and the js file for my solution is shown in the repo.
Thanks.

# Easy Level Challenges
Day 1 (✅)=> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/simple-array-sum/problem 
Day 2 (✅)=> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/compare-the-triplets/problem
Day 3 (✅)=> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/diagonal-difference/problem
Day 4 (✅)=> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/staircase/problem
Day 5 (✅)=> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/plus-minus/problem
Day 6 (✅)=> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/counting-valleys/problem
This day 6 challemge was weird. I wrote a very complicated process that was solving the challenge but it wasn't nearly properly optimized. So I had to brainstorm with @cokejnr and we came up with an algorithm that would allow us loop over the string just once. Unlike when I was looping over the string multiple times. Beautiful tbh.

Day 7 (✅)=> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/mini-max-sum/problem
Day 8 (✅)=> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/birthday-cake-candles/problem
Day 9 (✅)=> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/time-conversion/problem
This problem involved using sooo many ifs and else statements.

Day 10 (✅)=> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/grading/problem

# Medium Level Challenges
Day 11 (❌)=> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/extra-long-factorials/problem
Day 11 is giving me bigint variable issues. will have to come back for it
Day 12 (❌)=> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/magic-square-forming/problem
Day 12 has not been solved till now due to lack of understanding.
Day 13 (✅)=> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/encryption/problem
Day 14 (❌)=> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/organizing-containers-of-balls/problem
Day 15 (❌)=> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/queens-attack-2/problem
Almost done with this challenge. Almost. I need to figure out how to count in the second diagonal. I have some of the files saved in my office folder. Not sure how to get them here.
Day 16 (✅,❌)=> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/climbing-the-leaderboard/problem
Day 17 (❌)=> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/bigger-is-greater/problem
Day 18 (❌)=> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/non-divisible-subset/problem
Day 19 (✅)=> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/the-grid-search/problem
What a day of hardwork. This problem pushed me to the limits. sweet to finally solve it. Hints? limit your search range, Do you really need to search the entire grid?
Day 20 (✅,❌)=> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/fraudulent-activity-notifications/problem?isFullScreen=true

# Advanced Level Challenges
Day 21 (❌)=> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/matrix-rotation-algo/problem
Day 22 (❌)=> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/determining-dna-health/problem
Day 23 (❌)=> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/morgan-and-a-string/problem
Day 24 (❌)=> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/string-function-calculation/problem
Day 25 (❌)=> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/super-functional-strings/problem
Day 26 (❌)=> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/string-similarity/problem
Day 27 (❌)=> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ashton-and-string/problem
Day 28 (❌)=> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/cards-permutation/problem
Day 29 (❌)=> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/gridland-provinces/problem
Day 30 (❌)=> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/build-a-string/problem

# BONUS problems
Day 31 (✅)=> Write a function that takes a string as a parameter and returns the longest word of the string. If there are multiple strings, return the strin with the highest number of vowels. Do this in the most efficient way. 

Those Advanced challlenges are absolutely killing. Impossible in my head. I'm gonna be back.

I WILL BE BACK!!!

Hint to Future Tega(lol)
I think you need to understand data structures in detail. Your current understanding is way too limited to tackle those Advanced Challenges rn.
You also need to approach problem solving concepts from the same angle. However, you need to increase your understanding and breakdown of problems. Right now, you have a limited understadning of problems which automatically hampers your chances of solving these problems.
I expect an upgraded version of yourself when you get back to attempting these problems.
